<p>A lot of blogs and tech sites have a habit of putting their predictions for the coming year. I've generally refrained from doing the same since I find such posts boring, unintuitive, and repetitive. However, given the lack of posts I've had the last few months, I've decided I wanted to bump up my reader count with useless blabber. Here are my predictions for 2014:</p><ul><li>The NSA will buy Android from Google and make the world's first super-secure operating system that no one but the NSA can tap into.</li><li>HP will resurrect Palm in a last-ditch effort to remain relevent in the smartphone wars.</li><li>Microsoft will compete with NSA's super-secure mobile OS by ditching Windows Phone and adopting OpenBSD. The world's most unusable phone will be created.</li><li>The Onion will become US citizen's first choice for fair and balanced political news.</li><li>Nike will implement DRM with their shoes. Only approved shoelaces will work with Nike shoes.</li><li>Velcro-brand hook and loop will follow Nike's example.</li><li>The TSA will stop 1.5 terrorist attacks.</li></ul>
