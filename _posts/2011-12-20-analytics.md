I blogged yesterday about the <a href="/blog/lattera/2011-12-19/solaris-11-source-leaked">Solaris 11 source code leaking</a> and <a href="blog/lattera/2011-12-19/encrypted-zfs-freebsd">encrypted ZFS pools in FreeBSD</a>. This little tech blog generally gets around 20-40 hits per day. Yesterday saw nearly 4,000 hits. Today has so far logged around 2,000 more. My G+ <a href="https://plus.google.com/104264751185246203668/posts/MxyUP7dLJrf" target="_blank">post</a> says it all. I can't believe my server was able to survive so many hits. I did a good job in setting it up. It's literally sitting in my closet at home. I'm excited for many more exciting posts to come.
