Over the past 48 hours, you've probably noticed that the site has gone down and come back up periodically. I've been working on implementing IPv6 on my network at home. Thanks to <a href="http://he.net/" target="_blank">Hurricane Electric</a>, I now have IPv6 enabled at home. I've set up a AAAA DNS record on 0xfeedface.org. I'm excited to have IPv6 enabled. Please let me know if there are issues to resolve regarding IPv6 connectivity to my site.
