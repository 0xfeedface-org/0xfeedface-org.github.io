When my server died, I haven't had the opportunity to get at my backed-up data. I finally got at my backups and grabbed the database for my old tech blog. The <a href="http://archive.0xfeedface.org/" target="_blank">archive</a> is now back online. There's a lot of useful information and opinion there that I hope to never lose. I'm glad to have it back online.
