After purchasing Sun, Oracle decided to abandon and alienate the opensource community by closing Solaris' source code. Bryan Cantrill talked about the issues surrounding Solaris, IllumOS, and Oracle this year at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc" target="_blank">USENIX LISA 2011</a> (YouTube video of the talk). It seems that earlier this morning, a disgruntled Oracle employee <a href="http://openindiana.org/pipermail/openindiana-discuss/2011-December/006542.html" target="_blank">leaked</a> the source code behind Solaris 11. I'm glad the source has leaked. It serves Oracle right. They've proved that all they care about is greed. They don't innovate. I'm sure FreeBSD and IllumOS developers alike are researching the legality of incorporating the leaked code.
