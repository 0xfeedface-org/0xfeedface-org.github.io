title: Jailadmin Drupal Module 0.5.1 Released
created: 1358385052

I just released a maintenance update, 0.5.1, of my FreeBSD jail administration Drupal module. It fixes an IPv6 bug and has two minor usability enhancements. You can find the tarball <a href="http://0xfeedface.org/~shawn/projects/jailadmin/jailadmin-7.x-0.5.1.tar.gz">here</a>. As usual, you can follow the project at <a href="https://github.com/lattera/drupal-jailadmin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The update should be in FreeBSD's ports tree soon.
