For the past year, I've been working for Wayfair. I've really enjoyed working with such an outstanding company. However, it's time for me to look for new opportunities. My wife and I will be relocating. We're looking at relocating to Provo, UT, San Francisco, CA, or Washington, DC. I'm excited for what lies ahead for my wife and me. Please note that this site will be offline during the relocation.
