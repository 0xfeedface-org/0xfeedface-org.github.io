I tested my server yesterday to see if it would support FreeBSD 9. It appears that my motherboard isn't fully supported, which could be why I had issues with ZFS on FreeBSD a few months ago. I will likely put off upgrading the motherboard on my server until summer. That means that I'll be sticking with OpenIndiana for a while longer. If IllumOS' KVM supports AMD processors before then, I might stay with OpenIndiana permanently. I'm happy to stay with OpenIndiana--it's stable, feature-complete, and does nearly everything I need it to.

If I do buy a new motherboard, I'll likely go the Intel route. Switching from AMD to Intel will open doors for my use case. I use virtualization heavily and Intel is the best supported platform for the OSs I typically use.
