(My first attempt at free-form poetry, in the style of song lyrics)

	Take me down
	To the Kernel Panic City
	Where the Wifi's gone
	And the blue screen's pretty

	Caused by a buffer overflow
	KASLR disabled by a mofo
	Now my thread's in a bind
	And I should respond in kind

	Take me down
	To the Kernel Panic City
	Where the wifi's gone
	and the blue screen's pretty

	From vuln to 0day
	Written on RMS' birthday
	Disabling SELinux like a pro
	To show grsec's the way to go

	Take me down
	To the Kernel Panic City
	Where the wifi's gone
	and the blue screen's pretty

	Got a patch in hand
	Linux politics taste bland
	Rejected because it's useful
	I'm not the one responsible

	Take me down
	To the Kernel Panic City
	Where the wifi's gone
	and the blue screen's pretty
