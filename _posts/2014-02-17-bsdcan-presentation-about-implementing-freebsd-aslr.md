title: BSDCan Presentation About Implementing FreeBSD ASLR
created: 1392690878
---
I have the privilege of publicly representing <a href="https://www.soldierx.com/" target="_blank">SoldierX</a> by speaking at <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/2014/" target="_blank">BSDCan</a>, a BSD-centric conference held every year in Ottawa, Canada, this year about the work I did in behalf of SoldierX of porting grsec's/PaX's ASLR to FreeBSD (credit where credit is due: I enhanced and finished already-existing, but unfinished, patches provided by other awesome developers). The BSDCan people are finalizing the scheduling. I should have updates on the exact day/time of the presentation when the date gets closer. The presentation should, just as last year, be both streamed live and recorded. Once the schedule is posted online, I'll follow up with a comment on this post with a link.
