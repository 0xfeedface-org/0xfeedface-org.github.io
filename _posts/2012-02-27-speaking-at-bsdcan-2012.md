I'm excited to announce that I will be speaking at BSDCan 2012. BSDCan is a conference held in May in Ottawa, Canada. I will be speaking about creating a cloud-like infrastructure using FreeBSD, ZFS, and vnet jails. I will be releasing a tool to make administration of vnet jails extremely easy. A draft version of the slides are already available on BSDCan's site in Microsoft Powerpoint format. After my presentation, I will post a final version of the slides in PDF format here.

I will be speaking on May 11th. Unless plans change, I plan to be in Ottawa May 8th through May 14th. If you'd like to meet me, feel free to drop me a line.
