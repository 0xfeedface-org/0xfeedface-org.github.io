I will be presenting about libhijack at Weber State University in Ogden, UT on Feb 21st, 2012, at 1:30 PM. The presentation is free to attend and everyone is welcome. It's the same as my Defcon 19 talk, with new information about porting libhijack to FreeBSD. I will be releasing version 0.6 of libhijack after the presentation. Version 0.6 is coming along very nicely and is ready for release. I'm excited for this release. More information to come.

Take a look at this <a href="http://www.0xfeedface.org/~shawn/screenies/2012-01-29_libhijack_freebsd_amd64.png" target="_blank">screenshot</a> for a sneak peak of version 0.6!
