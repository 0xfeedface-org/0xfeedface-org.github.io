This time a year ago, I was averaging around 600 unique visitors per month. Now I'm averaging several thousand. I've outgrown this little VPS. It can't handle keeping the site online while running OS upgrades. Some of you probably noticed a bit of downtime yesterday. That was due to running critical updates. During this next week, I'm planning on migrating some services over to different boxes. You will notice a little more downtime. Hopefully this transition will go smoothly.
