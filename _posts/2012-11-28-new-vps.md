If you're reading this. You've successfully made the switch to the new server. The old one will be going down in around a week. Things that I'll be able to do with this new server:
<ul>
<li>Host nightly builds of my FreeBSD 10-current and 9-stable branches</li>
<li>Host public and private git repositories</li>
<li>Host other services</li>
</ul>

I'll be working on getting some IPv6-only jails online.
