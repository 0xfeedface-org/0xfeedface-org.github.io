May is going to be a very busy time for me. The first two weeks I'll be touring Salt Lake City and Canada, speaking about two subjects I blog about often: libhijack and creating a cloud-like infrastructure with FreeBSD vnet jails. On the evening of May 3rd, I'll be speaking for my <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Salt_Lake" target="_blank">local OWASP chapter</a> about libhijack. I'm really excited. My local OWASP chapter has some really knowledgeable people. Attendance is free, so come and learn about libhijack.

The <a href="http://conference.utos.org/" target="_blank">UT Open Source Conference</a> is going to be held May 3rd through the 5th at Utah Valley University. I submitted two presentations (both the presentations I wrote about above). They haven't told me which of the two--or both--was accepted and when it will be. I'll keep you all updated via <a href="https://twitter.com/lattera" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Feel free to drop by and say hi.

<a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/2012/" target="_blank">BSDCan</a> will be held May 11th-12th in Ottawa, Canada. I will be speaking May 11th about creating a cloud-like infrastructure with FreeBSD vnet jails. Again, feel free to drop by and say hi.

I'm really excited for the events coming up within the next few weeks. I hope the material presented will be of outstanding quality and I can contribute some ideas back to the opensource community.
