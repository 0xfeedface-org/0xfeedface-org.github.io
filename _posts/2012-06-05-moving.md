I'm proud to announce that I've accepted a position at Sourcefire in Columbia, MD. My wife and I will be moving out there by the end of June. I'm really excited for this new adventure. Please note that there will be downtime (of course) as I relocate my server. I hope to get off Comcast and on to Verizon FIOS.
