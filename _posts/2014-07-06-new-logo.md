I've been following the web comic <a href="http://www.loadingartist.com/" target="_blank">Loading Artist</a> for a while. I thought the character depicted in <a href="http://www.loadingartist.com/comic/man-enough/" target="_blank">Man Enough</a> was a perfect fit for 0xfeedface. I contacted Gregor, the author of the web comic, and asked him to see if I could use the character. You can tell that by my using the character, he said it was okay. Anyways, I just thought I'd give a special shout out to him since I like his work and he's awesome for allowing me to use his character. Props to him!
