title: New Release of My Jailadmin Project
created: 1371431194

I've just released version 0.6.2 of my FreeBSD jail administration Drupal module. This is a minor fix that includes new watchdog logging, especially when jails fail to start. I've also fixed a number of bugs. As always, if you would like to take a look at the code, feel free to check the project out on <a href="https://github.com/lattera/drupal-jailadmin" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You can download the tarball from <a href="http://0xfeedface.org/~shawn/projects/jailadmin/jailadmin-7.x-0.6.2.tar.gz">here</a>. I've submitted a PR to update the www/drupal7-jailadmin port to reflect the updated version.
