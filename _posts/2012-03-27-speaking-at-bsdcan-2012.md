I'll be speaking at BSDCan this year about creating a basic cloud-like infrastructure with FreeBSD, ZFS, vnet, and jails. I've been researching this topic for the last few months and creating various implementations. I'm really excited to give this presentation. The BSDCan fellows gave my 30-minute presentation a 60-minute slot, so if you're coming, come with questions. You can find the page for my presentation <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/2012/schedule/events/289.en.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

I've created a <a href="http://bit.ly/GTmqZH" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> for the events I want to go to. Feel free to hit me up in Canada. I'll be arriving on the 8th of May and departing on the 13th.
